<h2>Corsework Description ðŸ“š</h2><br/>

<h3>The University requires a program to predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic 
year. You should write this program in Python using the data shown in Table 1.  </h3>

<p><h2>Part 1 - Student Version </h2><br/>
<ol>
<li>The program should allow students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each 
academic year. </li>
<li>The program should prompt for the number of credits at pass, defer and fail and then display the 
appropriate progression outcome for an individual student. </li>
<li>The program should let the user know if a credit input is the wrong data type. I.e., â€˜Integers 
requiredâ€™ is displayed. </li>
<li>The program should let the user know if credits are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 
120. I.e., â€˜Range errorâ€™ is displayed. </li>
<li>The program should let the user know if the total of the pass, defer and fail credits is not 120. 
I.e., â€˜Total incorrectâ€™ is displayed. </li>
<ul> 
<li>Use conditions and user-defined functions in your solution as appropriate.</li>
<li>Flow Diagram - Before you start to program your solution you should create your flow diagram 
that represents your algorithm in a structured manner. Submit flowchart for Part 1 for marking. </li>
<li>Test Plan - A Part 1 test plan is provided in the appendix. Submit the completed test plan (with 
your flow diagram and program code) and bring a printed copy of the test plan to the demo. </li>

<p><h2>Part 2 - Staff Version</h2> <br/>
This extension should meet the requirements specified for Part 1 but also allow a staff member to 
predict progression outcomes for multiple students. 
<ol>
<li>The program should prompt for credits at pass, defer and fail and display the appropriate 
progression for each individual student until the staff member user enters â€˜qâ€™ to quit. </li>
<li>When â€˜qâ€™ is entered, the program should produce a â€˜histogramâ€™ where each star represents a 
student who achieved a progress outcome in the category range: progress, trailing, module 
retriever and exclude. See example below. </li>
<li>The program should display the number of students for each progression category and the total 
number of outcomes processed. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The program will make use of loops and user-defined functions. </li>
<li>Flow Diagram - Before you start to program your solution you should create your flow diagram 
that represents your algorithm in a structured manner. Submit flowchart for Part 2 for marking. </li>
<li>Test Plan â€“ You are required to create your own test plan for Part 2. Submit the completed Part 2 
test plan (with your flow diagram and program code) and bring a printed copy to the demo</li>
</ul>

This following horizontal histogram example shows the output distribution for 20 outcomes. 
However, your program should work with any number of outcomes generated.

<p><h2>Part 3 - Vertical Histogram (optional extension)</h2> <br/>
Extend your program to add an additional histogram that displays vertically so the stars in a category 
should go downwards and not across the screen, e.g.:</p><br/>

<ul>
<li>Hint: as a line is printed decide if each category needs a star or space. </li>
<li>Part 3 does NOT require a flow diagram or a test plan. </li>
</ul>

<p>Part 4 â€“ Alternative Staff Version (optional extension) <br/>
For this staff version the data will be accessed from a list, tuple or dictionary and NOT from user 
input. The data held in the list, tuple or dictionary will match the test cases 1 to 10 shown in the 
appendix. Use user-defined functions. 
<ul>
<li>Part 4 does NOT require a flow diagram or a test plan. <li/>
<li>If attempted, the code for both staff versions (Part 2 and Part 4) must be submitted for marking. </li></ul></p>
